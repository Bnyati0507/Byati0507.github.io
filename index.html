                                the meaning of covid waste.Only 28% of them were aware of the harmful effects of covid

                                that covid waste are burnt or mixed with regular trash and disposed off without any
                                proper treatment
                                by waste management organisations.Everyone should know,should understand that used PPEs
                                such as goggles,face
                                shield,splash proof apron,plastic coverall,hazmet suit,nitrile gloves are hotspots of

                                Disposing them carelessly could cause an outbreak around that area that could engulf

                                aware you
                                about the different methods involved in safe disposal of waste.During lockdown due to
                                restricted travel, work from home,
                                increased online shopping, and higher food consumption at home have contributed
                                tremendously to household waste.
                                By home or community level composting or biogas generation from biodegradable wastes can
                                help in disposing these wastes.
                                Also face masks have become a key tool in the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic but
                                they are also proving a major new source
                                of pollution, with used masks seen littering streets, countryside and waterways across
                                the world. So this can be fixed by recycling
                                clothes used in it by turning them into a plastic-like material – also called Plaxtil.
                                By quarantining the masks for 4 days and
                                then grinding into small pieces and later passed through UV rays. After that they can be
                                used for making various productsBe a

                                duties that involve high exposure risks in areas with community
                                transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Many critical sectors depend on these workers
                                to continue their operations. These workers and their employers should
                                remain aware of the evolving community transmission risk. Employers
                                should assess the hazards to which their workers may be exposed; evaluate
                                the risk of exposure and ensure workers stick to SOP’s to prevent exposure.
                                Control measures may include a combination of engineering and
                                administrative controls, safe work practices, and use of masks and PPE.For more you all
